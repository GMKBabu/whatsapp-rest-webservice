# WhatsApp REST Webservice
A Python/Django REST webservice using Yowsup to send messages to WhatsApp. WIP.

# Getting started

## Setting up the environment
Get the source.

    git clone https://github.com/svub/whatsapp-rest-webservice.git
    cd whatsapp-rest-webservice

Make sure you have Python env installed. Then, open the virtual environment.

    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv --no-site-packages --distribute env && source env/bin/activate

Install the dependencies.

    pip install django djangorestframework coreapi

Initialize Django by creating an empty database and a superuser to secure the REST webservices.

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser
When running createsuperuser, you'll have to choose which username and password you want to set to secure the service. It's required as otherwise anybody could send messages on your behalf.

Initialize Yowsup
You'll see a lot of console output running the following command - also warnings - and it'll take a while. But everything is good if it ends with "Finished processing dependencies for yowsup2==2.5.2".

    cd service/yowsup/ && python setup.py install && cd ../../

## Setting up your WhatsApp account
You'll need a registered WhatsApp account and a working mobile phone number to do the setup.

### 1. Register your phone

    yowsup-cli registration --cc <country code> --phone <country code><phone no> --mcc <MCC code> --requestcode sms
* Country code without "+" or "00", e.g. for Germany it's "49"
* Example phone number with German country code: 4917616702776
* The MCC is an ID of your provider, you can find a [List of MMCs on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code), for Germany, it's O2 26203, Telekom 26201, and Vodafone 26202

### 2. Activiate your phone.
After sending out the registration request, you should have received an SMS with a code that you'll need now.

    yowsup-cli registration --cc <country code> --phone <country code><phone no> --mcc <MCC code> --register <code received via SMS>

This will print you a result similar to this:

    status: ok
    kind: free
    pw: +BaimGldHiWhr0oseHxbSScF3vT=
    price: 0,89 â‚¬
    price_expiration: 1501987180
    currency: EUR
    cost: 0.89
    expiration: 4444444444.0
    login: 4910716702776
    type: existing
We'll need the password from the third line (starting with "pw:") - in this example "+BaimGldHiWhr0oseHxbSScF3vT=".

## Configuring the service
Customize your config file, and insert your full phone number (again with CC) and the password from the previous step.

    cp service/whatsapp.example.conf service/whatsapp.conf && nano service/whatsapp.conf

## Running the service
Testing the service locally - available for localhost only on port 8000.

    python manage.py runserver

Run the service publically - you'll need sudo to run a service on port 80 - or use a port like 8000 to run it without sudo.

    sudo python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
